## What is the Inter-Operability Platform (IOP)?

ScienceMesh is the Federated Science Cloud Mesh that connects existing and heterogenous sites
in a transparent way. In order to ensure inter-operability, it is important that sites are able to talk to each other independently of the technology stack. 
For this reason, the IOP is a component to be deployed on each site to ensure compatibilty between sites, and ability to join ScienceMesh.


### How to deploy the IOP?
We have prepared some guides on how to deploy the IOP, check the link below.
