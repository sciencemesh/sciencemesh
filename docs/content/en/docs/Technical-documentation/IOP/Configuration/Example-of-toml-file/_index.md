  Here you can find an example of toml file needed to set up all necessary services for your reva instance. It consists of the services described in the others [Configuration sections](../../configuration). This toml file is used for [REVA deployment](../../deployment) and referenced there as `standalone.toml`.

---

The reference toml file for reva deployment is available [here](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/blob/master/examples/sciencemesh/sciencemesh.toml).

An additional toml file is available [here](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/blob/master/examples/sciencemesh/sciencemesh-apps.toml) to run apps, but it is not yet integrated, therefore please do not use it yet.


To get an understanding on how to create, use and manage Reva configuration,
please refer to the [official Reva documentation](https://reva.link/docs/getting-started/beginners-guide/).


> **IMPORTANT**: To use the example file, you need to change the values inside of the example to those according to your instance and deployment.
